    This code defines a function called save_documents that saves a list of objects to JSON files. 
    
    Each object in the list should have two properties: 
    the name of the document that was chunked, and the chunked data itself. 
    
    The JSON file should be named after the document name, with "Chunks" appended to the end of the name. 
    
    The content of the JSON file should be the chunked data. 
    
    The function uses the os and json modules to create the directory for the chunked data if it doesn't exist, 
    and to save the documents to JSON files with dynamic names. 
    
    The resulting JSON files are saved in the directory specified by the save_json_chunks_directory argument.
