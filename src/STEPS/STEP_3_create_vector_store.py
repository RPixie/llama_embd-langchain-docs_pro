"""
    This code defines a function called create_vectorstore_from_json that creates a FAISS index 
    from text embeddings extracted from JSON files in a specified directory. 

    The function takes two arguments: 
        json_files_directory which is the path to the directory containing the JSON files, and 
        model_path which is the path to the model used for generating embeddings. 

    The function: 
        loads the embeddings, 
        reads the JSON files, 
        extracts the text values, 
        creates text embedding pairs, and 
        creates a FAISS index from the pairs.
